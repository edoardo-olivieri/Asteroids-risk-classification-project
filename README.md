## Description

This project was developed as part of a research project to evaluate different classification techniques for assessing asteroid risks.
In this project, we analyzed and compared various **classification methods** to assess the risk posed by asteroids. Using both **statistical models** and **machine learning techniques**, we aimed to classify asteroids based on their potential to pose a threat to Earth. Our approach involved evaluating multiple models, including decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, and random forest, to determine which method performed best in predicting asteroid risk levels.

The key components of the project include:
- **EDA**: Conducted to understand the distribution of asteroid features such as size, velocity, and orbital parameters. This phase helped us identify trends, correlations, and potential outliers in the data.
- **Modeling**: Implementing and testing various classification algorithms for classification tasks.
- **Evaluation**: Comparing models based on their performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, F1 score and ROC curves.
- **Results**: The results highlight which classification method is best suited for identifying high-risk asteroids under different conditions.
